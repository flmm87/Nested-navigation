# Nested Navigation

## Overview

#### Imagine a sleek mobile app designed to showcase Nested Navigation in React Native. 
Developed during my studies as part of my pursuit of a junior role in mobile app development, this app serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in building complex navigation structures. While the app is currently inactive,
it offers a glimpse into a user-friendly interface featuring a variety of food categories.
Each category seamlessly expands to reveal a curated selection of delicious dishes, demonstrating the power and flexibility of nested navigation in React Native.
It's important to note that while the UI may not be perfect, this app was built with a focus on perfecting nested navigation skills rather than achieving visual perfection. 

Despite its current state, this project reflects my dedication to learning and mastering React Native, particularly in implementing nested navigation patterns 
to enhance user interaction and engagement.
